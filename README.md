* Overview

This app is designed for Turing Students to track their wellness goals.  Goals can be set each week in four categories: "Nutrition", "Personal", "Sleep", and "Sweat". A student sets his or her own goals on Monday of each week. Students can create goals for each category (as many goals as they like per week per category, with no more than a count of 7-one for each day of the week- for each individual goal).  Goals must be marked completed by the end of the day on Sunday.  Goals do not reset at the start of each new week. A user must enter his or her goals each new week.
